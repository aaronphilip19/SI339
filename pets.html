                Chase is a 4 year old Labrador who resides in Dubai. His favorite activities include going on morning walks with his parents and lazily lying on the cold tiling in the house watching TV. His morning routine includes lightly banging on the glass-paned door gesturing for his breakfast that he so looks forward to every day. His breakfast serves as the fuel he needs to frolic around whilst I play basketball in his play area.

                Chase is quite the socialite when it comes to human interaction. He loves meeting strangers and often looks forward to engaging with his family’s friends whenever they are about. Sometimes his sheer enthusiasm can work to his detriment amongst strangers who are fearful of dogs wherein such enthusiasm only serves to build up fear. However, his extroverted nature is nowhere to be seen around other dogs as he becomes more reclusive and wants to hang around his parents solely.</p>
